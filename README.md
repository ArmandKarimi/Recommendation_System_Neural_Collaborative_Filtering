# 🎬 Neural Collaborative Filtering with Content Features

This notebook implements a **hybrid movie recommendation system** using a neural network in PyTorch. It combines collaborative filtering (user/movie interactions) with content-based features such as genres, tags, directors, and reviews, embedded using SentenceTransformers.

## 📚 Dataset
